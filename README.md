### Introduction to the problem
Nowadays, there is an uncertainty on the price that should be paid for a second hand vehicle. There are several classified ad pages that promote car prices, but how many of them are you telling which ones have a fair price?

### Objective
This car value appraiser aim is to use machine learning algorithms to find a fair price for used cars. Second hand cars market is quite variable, so this analysis is focused on the technical specifications of each vehicle. Therefore, the ML model will be directed by correlated features to the main target, the price.
